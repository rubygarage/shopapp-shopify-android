# Installation
## Connect the library

To use the ShopApp provider for Shopify, connect the library to the [main application](https://github.com/rubygarage/shopapp-android) with Gradle:

``` 
implementation "com.github.rubygarage:shopapp-shopify-android:1.0.3" 
```

## Change the ShopApplication file
Next, change the **app/src/main/java/com/shopapp/ShopApplication.kt** file by adding the following code: 

``` 
//Initialize your api here.
val api = ShopifyApi(this, "SHOP DOMAIN", "API KEY", "ADMIN API KEY", "ADMIN API PASSWORD")
appComponent = buildAppComponent(api, dao) 
```

Where: 
**SHOP DOMAIN** - is the main domain of your store. You can find it your store's domain by visiting the admin panel on a Home tab. There you can find the following message - Your current domain is xxx.myshopify.com

**API KEY** is used to receive your store's data like items and collections. To receive the key, you have to visit the admin panel and proceed to Apps - Manage Private Apps. Create a new application if you don't have one by copying Storefront API and adding it to your library's configuration

**ADMIN API KEY** is a key for Admin API. The library uses the key to receive a list of countries eligible to shipping.

**ADMIN PASSWORD** is a password for Admin API.
